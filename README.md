MVP - Creating a website which would provide an option of different bands, with the possibility of getting more information on their albums, the date the band formed and their best songs.

Repo installation -
1. The master branch has been protected, to avoid any confusion for the team while pushing and pulling data from and to the master branch. In saying so, each commit will need a pull request, which has to be reviewed by any member of the team, prior to merging it to the master branch.

2. A package.json has already be installed as well as jest in case we need to conduct any test through our project, again i dont think time wise, it is realistic but if it is NEEDED as part of the project making, we can conduct them via jest(scripts already setup as well as node .)

3. In terms of creation of branches to work on and merging them to the master branch, as per my short research, it is said to be good practice to create a branch as per a feature of our application. (N.B: features are anything and everything on an application, from the written content, to images, links, forms, table, any dynamic options there for the user to explore and use.) For instance; if Raf and Daryl are on the back end for setting up the server its one branch then pull request, merge the request delete the branch create new branch for another feature. And each branch name should be connected to the feature worked on, so it is easily tracked when we go back to our repo.

4. In order to track our progress and allocate task I thought to sare that github provides this possibility under projects where we can set task and allocate them to each of us and once there is a pull request merge github automatically moves the task to done. (optional but thought i would share)

5. The repos has a folder for images and any resource we would be needing tomorrow. Feel free to add folders as needed whether needed on the front end or back end.

Cool beans! LetÂ´s do this !
